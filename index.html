      <h2>Why These Are My Favorite Animals 🐒</h2>
      <p>
        These are my favorite Animals because they are all diverse and appealing
        in their own ways
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Orangutans</li>

        <p>Orangutans are slightly orange which makes their name misleading. Most Orangutans are very round and fat, If you see a skinny Orangutan then that Orangutan Is malnutrisionized.
          
        <li>Bears</li>

        <p>
          Bears are very large and vary in colors depending on the terrain they
          are in. Despite being maybe dangerous and deadly we can only admire them from afar.

        <p> Hamsters are also very round and vary in colors, There is a pattern in my favorite animals...
